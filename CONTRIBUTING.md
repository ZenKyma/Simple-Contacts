### Where to contribute
Since this is a fork of [Simple Contacts Pro](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Contacts) which will be updated with changes from the original app 
from time to time, you can either choose to contribute to the original app or to the fork.
This fork is focussed on the structured address feature which is not desired in the original app, it seems natural contribute everything related to this 
feature in this fork.
